Could be the mint wasn't working (like what happened to me) the mint didn't go through and didn't even end up debiting my account. Could be a lot of things, but if it confirmed after the mintout then it won't be valid. I hope it",

How could there be inscribers ahead of me when we are both using max fees but I submitted before them?",
